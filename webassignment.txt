2) watch & summary 5 points - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConf

      In Rendering we have Parsing,Layout,Painting. The below steps how the browser actually does rendering
        1) Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
        2) Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.
        3) Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree.
        4) Run layout on the render tree to compute geometry of each node.
        5) Paint the individual nodes to the screen.


3) To read - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags
      
      It's true that the HTML specs permit certain tags to be omitted in certain cases, but generally doing so is unwise.
      It has two effects - it makes the spec more complex, which in turn makes it harder for browser authors to write correct implementations.
      This makes the likelihood of browser errors in these parts of the spec high. 
      
4) Execute the bellow code and write your description in txt file
        typeof(1)
        typeof(1.1)
        typeof('1.1')
        typeof(true)
        typeof(null)
        typeof(undefined)
        typeof([])
        typeof({})
        typeof(NaN)
        
        output:
        typeof(1)
        "number"
        typeof(1.1)
        "number"
        typeof('1.1')
        "string"
        typeof(true)
        "boolean"
        typeof(null)
        "object"
        typeof(undefined)
        "undefined"
        typeof([])
        "object"
        typeof({})
        "object"
        typeof(NaN)
        "number"
